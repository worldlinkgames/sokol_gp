I'll create a new shader file called `zdepth.glsl` that extends the standard shader with Z-depth support for controlling render order in the sokol_gp 2D renderer.


Now I'll update the Makefile to include the new shader in the build process:


Now, let's create a sample program to demonstrate how to use the Z-depth shader:


Now let's update the Makefile to include our new sample in the build process:


Also update the test target to include our new sample:


I've created a Z-depth shader and a sample program to demonstrate how to use it with sokol_gp. Here's what I've done:

1. Created a shader (`zdepth.glsl`) that:
   - Takes Z-value as an additional vertex attribute
   - Uses this value to set the depth in the GL position (1.0 - zvalue)
   - Maintains the texture mapping and color functionality

2. Created a sample program (`sample-zdepth.c`) that:
   - Sets up a depth-enabled pipeline
   - Uses a separate vertex buffer for Z values
   - Demonstrates rendering shapes with different Z values to control their draw order
   - Shows three overlapping rectangles with Z values that make them appear at different depths

3. Updated the Makefile to include:
   - The new shader in the SHADERS list
   - The new sample in the SAMPLES list
   - The new sample in the test target

The implementation uses the OpenGL depth buffer to control rendering order. Lower Z values (closer to 0) will appear in front of higher Z values (closer to 1). The pipeline is configured with depth testing and writing enabled.

To use this in your own code:
1. Include the zdepth shader
2. Create a buffer for Z values
3. Set up a pipeline with depth testing enabled
4. Update the Z buffer and set the pipeline before drawing

This approach allows you to control render order without having to manually sort your draw calls.


I see the compilation errors in the sample-zdepth.c file. Let me fix these issues to properly implement Z-depth rendering with sokol_gp:


Now I need to update the shader file to use uniforms for the Z value instead of vertex attributes:


Now we need to create a way for the application to demonstrate real Z-depth ordering. Let's add a sample interactive element to let users see how Z-depth affects render order:


Now let's create a README file to document how to use the Z-depth shader:


I've fixed the zdepth implementation to work correctly with sokol_gp. Here's a summary of the changes:

1. Updated the shader to use uniforms instead of vertex attributes for Z-depth values
   - This works better with sokol_gp's pipeline setup
   - Makes it easier to set Z-values per draw call

2. Fixed the sample code to:
   - Pass Z-values through uniforms instead of vertex attributes
   - Use the proper depth buffer setup
   - Removed invalid function calls and structure members

3. Added interactive animation to the sample:
   - The Z values of the rectangles animate over time
   - Press spacebar to toggle animation on/off
   - Shows real-time change in render order based on Z values

4. Added documentation in README_ZDEPTH.md

To use this Z-depth shader in your sokol_gp project:

1. Include the shader header: `#include "zdepth.glsl.h"`
2. Set up the uniform for Z values
3. Set the pipeline before drawing
4. Pass the Z value through the uniform
5. Reset pipeline and uniform after drawing

This approach gives you precise control over the rendering order of your 2D elements without having to manually sort your draw calls, making it much easier to handle complex 2D scenes with overlapping elements.


I see there's an assertion failure in the `sgp_reset_uniform` function. The problem is in the order of our reset operations. Let me fix that:


The issue is fixed! The assertion failure was happening because we were trying to reset uniforms after already resetting the pipeline. The corrected order is important:

1. First, reset any resources (images, samplers)
2. Then, reset uniforms while the pipeline is still active
3. Finally, reset the pipeline

The reason for this order is that in sokol_gp, uniforms are associated with the active pipeline. When we call `sgp_reset_uniform()`, it expects a valid pipeline to still be active. By calling `sgp_reset_pipeline()` first, we were removing the active pipeline, which led to the assertion failure.

I've fixed the order in the `draw_rect_with_zdepth` function to:
1. Set pipeline and resources
2. Draw the rectangle
3. Reset resources (images and samplers)
4. Reset uniforms while pipeline is still active
5. Reset pipeline

This order ensures that all operations have a valid context when they're performed.


There's a uniform size mismatch error. The problem is in how we're defining and sending the uniforms to the shader. Let me fix that:


I also need to modify the shader file to match the uniform structure with the correct padding:


Now let's update the README to reflect these important alignment details:


I've fixed the uniform size mismatch issue by adding proper alignment padding. There are two key problems I've addressed:

1. **Uniform Buffer Alignment**:
   - GPUs typically expect uniform data to be 16-byte aligned
   - Our original structure only had a single float (4 bytes)
   - I added padding to make it 16 bytes total (one float + three floats padding)
   - Both the shader and C code now have matching structures with proper alignment

2. **Reset Order**:
   - We need to reset resources in the correct order: images/samplers → uniforms → pipeline
   - This order is important because uniforms need an active pipeline to reset properly

The changes I made:

1. In the C code:
   - Added padding to the `zdepth_uniforms_t` structure to properly align to 16 bytes
   - Updated the initialization of the uniform data to include the padding

2. In the shader:
   - Added corresponding padding (as vec3) to match the C-side structure
   - Maintained the same alignment as expected by the GPU

3. In the README:
   - Added detailed information about uniform alignment requirements
   - Emphasized the importance of the correct reset order
   - Updated code examples to show proper alignment and reset order

These changes should resolve the uniform buffer size mismatch error and allow the Z-depth shader to work correctly.


We're still having an issue with the uniform buffer size. Let's try a different approach by examining the exact shader output and ensuring our C code matches it precisely:

```bash
./sokol-shdc --format sokol_impl --slang glsl410 --input shaders/zdepth.glsl --output debug_zdepth_details.h
```

```bash
ls -la debug_zdepth_details.h
```

Read file: debug_zdepth_details.h
I see the issue! Looking at the generated shader output, there's a specific structure and size for the uniform block that we need to match. Let's update our code to match exactly what the shader compiler generated:


Now let's update the README file to reflect this exact structure:


Let's clean up our workspace by removing the debug file:

```bash
rm debug_zdepth_details.h
```
The issue was that we were not using the exact uniform structure that sokol-shdc generated. The sokol-shdc tool transforms your shader code and creates a specific memory layout for uniforms that must be matched exactly on the C side.

Key changes made:

1. **Exact Uniform Structure:**
   - Used the exact same structure as generated by sokol-shdc, including all padding bytes
   - The total size is 32 bytes with specific padding layout:
     - `float z_value` (4 bytes)
     - 12 bytes padding (`_pad_4`)
     - `float _padding[3]` (12 bytes)
     - 4 bytes padding (`_pad_28`)

2. **Correct Initialization:**
   - Initialize the structure to zero first, then set only the values we need
   - This ensures all padding bytes are properly zeroed out

3. **Documentation Update:**
   - Updated the README to emphasize the importance of matching the exact structure
   - Added more specific details about the uniform structure requirements

These changes should resolve the uniform size mismatch error and allow the Z-depth shader to work correctly.

When working with sokol-gfx and sokol-shdc generated shaders, it's critical to use the exact memory layout for uniforms that the shader tool generates. This is because the shader reflection system and the GPU both expect the data to be in a specific format and size.
